Upcasting in Java (and similar object-oriented languages)

Upcasting in Java is the process of converting a subclass (child) object to a
superclass (parent) reference. It is implicit and does not require explicit
casting syntax because the child object contains all members of the parent class. 
Upcasting provides a simplified view of the subclass object by hiding its specific 
properties while retaining those of the parent, facilitating polymorphism and code 
flexibility. For example, if you have a subclass Dog extending a superclass Animal,
assigning a Dog object to an Animal reference is upcasting.

Key points about upcasting include:
It allows a subclass object to be treated as an instance of the parent class.
After upcasting, only the parent class's methods and variables are accessible,
not the subclass-specific ones, unless overridden.
It enables polymorphic behavior, such as passing subclass objects to methods 
expecting superclass parameters.
Upcasting is implicit and done automatically by the compiler.


class Animal {
    void eat() {
        System.out.println("This animal eats food");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    void bark() {
        System.out.println("Dog barks");
    }
}

public class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Dog dog = new Dog();        // Subclass object
        Animal animal = dog;        // Upcasting: Dog → Animal
        
        animal.eat();              // Works: eat() is in Animal
        // animal.bark();          // Error! bark() is specific to Dog
    }
}
