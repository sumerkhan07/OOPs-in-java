what is the polymorphism in the java?
Polymorphism in Java is a core concept of object-oriented programming
that allows an entity (such as a method or object) to take many forms. 
It enables the same method or function to behave differently based on
the object that invokes it or the arguments it receives.

--There are two main types of polymorphism in Java:
1 -- Compile-time Polymorphism (Static Polymorphism)
2 -- Runtime Polymorphism (Dynamic Polymorphism)


1-- Compile-time Polymorphism (Static Polymorphism)
It achieved through method overloading, where multiple methods have the same
name but differ in parameter lists within the same class. 
The correct method to be called is determined during compile time.

public class Compile {
    public  int test(int a, int b){
        return a+b;
    }
public int test(int a, int b ,int c){
        return c;
    }
public static void main(String[] args) {
        Compile compile=new Compile();
       int  d=compile.test(10,20);
        System.out.println(d);
        int x=compile.test(10,20,30);
        System.out.println(x);
    }
}


2 -- Runtime Polymorphism (Dynamic Polymorphism)
It achieved through method overriding, where a subclass provides its own implementation 
of a method defined in a superclass. The JVM decides at runtime which method to execute 
depending on the object's actual type.

class Animal {
    void sound() { System.out.println("Animal makes sound"); }
}
class Dog extends Animal {
    @Override
    void sound() { System.out.println("Dog barks"); }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Animal d=new Dog();
        d.sound();
    }
}
