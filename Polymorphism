what is the polymorphism in the java?
Polymorphism in Java is a core concept of object-oriented programming
that allows an entity (such as a method or object) to take many forms. 
It enables the same method or function to behave differently based on
the object that invokes it or the arguments it receives.

--There are two main types of polymorphism in Java:
1 -- Compile-time Polymorphism (Static Polymorphism)
2 -- Runtime Polymorphism (Dynamic Polymorphism)


1-- Compile-time Polymorphism (Static Polymorphism)
It achieved through method overloading, where multiple methods have the same
name but differ in parameter lists within the same class. 
The correct method to be called is determined during compile time.

public class Compile {
    public  int test(int a, int b){
        return a+b;
    }
public int test(int a, int b ,int c){
        return c;
    }
public static void main(String[] args) {
        Compile compile=new Compile();
       int  d=compile.test(10,20);
        System.out.println(d);
        int x=compile.test(10,20,30);
        System.out.println(x);
    }
}

--Method Overloading 
// Method having the same name but diffrent parameter is 
//within a same class is known as methd overloading.

--Constructor overloading 
/* In a class having the multiple constrcutor with diffrent parameter 
 is known as constructor overloading */

public class Employee {
    String name;
    int id;

    // Default constructor
    public Employee() {
        name = "Unknown";
        id = 0;
    }

    // Parameterized constructor with two parameters
    public Employee(String empName, int empId) {
        name = empName;
        id = empId;
    }

    public void display() {
        System.out.println("Name: " + name + ", ID: " + id);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Employee emp1 = new Employee(); // Calls default constructor
        Employee emp2 = new Employee("John", 101); // Calls parameterized constructor

        emp1.display(); // Output: Name: Unknown, ID: 0
        emp2.display(); // Output: Name: John, ID: 101
    }
}



2 -- Runtime Polymorphism (Dynamic Polymorphism)
It achieved through method overriding, where a subclass provides its own implementation 
of a method defined in a superclass. The JVM decides at runtime which method to execute 
depending on the object's actual type.

class Animal {
    void sound() { System.out.println("Animal makes sound"); }
}
class Dog extends Animal {
    @Override
    void sound() { System.out.println("Dog barks"); }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Animal d=new Dog();
        d.sound();
    }
}
