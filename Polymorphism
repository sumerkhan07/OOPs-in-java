what is the polymorphism in the java?
Polymorphism in Java is a core concept of object-oriented programming
that allows an entity (such as a method or object) to take many forms. 
It enables the same method or function to behave differently based on
the object that invokes it or the arguments it receives.

--There are two main types of polymorphism in Java:
1 -- Compile-time Polymorphism (Static Polymorphism)
2 --Runtime Polymorphism (Dynamic Polymorphism)
