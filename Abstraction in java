Abstraction in Java is the process of hiding internal implementation details and exposing only the essential 
features of an object or system to the outside world.
Abstraction is the process of hiding the details and providing only the necessary things to the end user.
More specifically, in software engineering and programming, abstraction means focusing on the essential
features while hiding the complex or irrelevant internal details from the user. This simplification allows 
users or other parts of a system to interact with an object or component without needing to understand its
complex inner workings.
This allows developers to focus on what an object does rather than how it accomplishes its functionality.​

Key Concepts
Abstraction reduces complexity by showing only necessary operations and hiding details, similar
to how a TV remote exposes buttons but conceals circuitry.​
In Java, abstraction can be achieved using abstract classes and interfaces.​
