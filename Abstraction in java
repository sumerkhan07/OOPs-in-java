Abstraction in Java is the process of hiding internal implementation details and exposing only the essential 
features of an object or system to the outside world.
Abstraction is the process of hiding the details and providing only the necessary things to the end user.
More specifically, in software engineering and programming, abstraction means focusing on the essential
features while hiding the complex or irrelevant internal details from the user. This simplification allows 
users or other parts of a system to interact with an object or component without needing to understand its
complex inner workings.
This allows developers to focus on what an object does rather than how it accomplishes its functionality.​

Key Concepts
Abstraction  reduces complexity by showing only necessary operations and hiding details, similar
to how a TV remote exposes buttons but conceals circuitry.​
In Java, abstraction can be achieved using abstract classes and interfaces.​


What is abstraction in Java?
Abstraction is the process of hiding internal implementation details and showing only essential functionality to the user. 
It focuses on what an object does rather than how it does it.

How is abstraction achieved in Java?
Through abstract classes (partial abstraction) and interfaces (full abstraction).

What is an abstract class?
A class declared with the abstract keyword that may have abstract methods without implementation. 
It cannot be instantiated directly and must be subclassed.

Can an abstract class have a constructor?
Yes, abstract classes can have constructors which are called when subclass objects are created.

Can you create an object of an abstract class?
No, you cannot create an instance of an abstract class directly.

What is the difference between an abstract class and an interface?
Abstract classes can have both abstract and non-abstract methods, 
whereas interfaces in Java define methods that are abstract by default. 
A class may extend only one abstract class but implement multiple interfaces.

Can an abstract class have non-abstract methods?
Yes, abstract classes can have both abstract and concrete methods.

What happens if you don’t override all abstract methods in a subclass?
The subclass must be declared abstract as well; otherwise, it results in a compile-time error.

How is abstraction different from encapsulation?
Abstraction hides implementation details by exposing only needed functionality,
whereas encapsulation hides data and code inside a class by binding them together.
